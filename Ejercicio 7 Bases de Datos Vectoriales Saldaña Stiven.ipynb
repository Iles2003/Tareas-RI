The originality of this aircraft was the shape of the fuselage, designed for minimum drag and acting as a tube fan, similar to the way the modern vertical take off aircraft and helicopters are designed. This shape reduced drag and increased the efficiency of the propeller. Helped by the Minister of Education, Spiru Haret, who also helped Aurel Vlaicu, in 1909 he went to France to acquire an engine for his aircraft. In Paris he sent a survey \\\"Laws of air dynamics\\\" to the French Academy, study that was published in \\\"La France automobile et a\\u00c3\\u00a9rienne\\\" magazine, on 15 May 1909. Goliescu patented his invention in France (patent no. 402329). In the same year he learned to fly and he built an updated version of his aircraft, this time in full size. The aircraft had a half cylinder fuselage, but still the air from the propeller flowed through as in the first model. He flies with his aircraft for the first time, in November 1909, on Juvisy airfield, near Paris, and he reaches an altitude of about 50 m. It was for the first time to fly an aircraft with a tubed propeller.\\n\\nAfter his flights, only in 1932, the Italian engineer Luigi Stipa will build an aircraft with a \\\"barrel fuselage\\\" under the name of Stipa-Caproni but the concept will reach its dedication after the Second World War, being successfully implemented in helicopters like SA-365 Dauphin, RAH-66 Comanche or the new X-35 fighter.\\n\\nBetween 1932 and 1936, he flight tested his \\\"Aviocoleopter\\\", the first vertical take-off and landing aircraft.\\n\\n\",\n          \"Push-button\\n\\nA push-button (also spelled pushbutton) or simply button is a simple switch mechanism for controlling some aspect of a machine or a process. Buttons are typically made out of hard material, usually plastic or metal. The surface is usually flat or shaped to accommodate the human finger or hand, so as to be easily depressed or pushed. Buttons are most often biased switches, although many un-biased buttons (due to their physical nature) still require a spring to return to their un-pushed state.\\nTerms for the \\\"pushing\\\" of a button include pressing, depressing, mashing, slapping, hitting, and punching.\\n\\nThe \\\"push-button\\\" has been utilized in calculators, push-button telephones, kitchen appliances, and various other mechanical and electronic devices, home and commercial.\\n\\nIn industrial and commercial applications, push buttons can be connected together by a mechanical linkage so that the act of pushing one button causes the other button to be released. In this way, a stop button can \\\"force\\\" a start button to be released. This method of linkage is used in simple manual operations in which the machine or process has no electrical circuits for control.\\n\\nRed pushbuttons can also have large heads (called mushroom heads) for easy operation and to facilitate the stopping of a machine. These pushbuttons are called emergency stop buttons and for increased safety are mandated by the electrical code in many jurisdictions. This large mushroom shape can also be found in buttons for use with operators who need to wear gloves for their work and could not actuate a regular flush-mounted push button.\\n\\nAs an aid for operators and users in industrial or commercial applications, a pilot light is commonly added to draw the attention of the user and to provide feedback if the button is pushed. Typically this light is included into the center of the pushbutton and a lens replaces the pushbutton hard center disk. The source of the energy to illuminate the light is not directly tied to the contacts on the back of the pushbutton but to the action the pushbutton controls. In this way a start button when pushed will cause the process or machine operation to be started and a secondary contact designed into the operation or process will close to turn on the pilot light and signify the action of pushing the button caused the resultant process or action to start.\\n\\nTo avoid an operator from pushing the wrong button in error, pushbuttons are often color-coded to associate them with their function. Commonly used colors are red for stopping the machine or process and green for starting the machine or process.\\n\\nIn popular culture, the phrase \\\"the button\\\" (sometimes capitalized) refers to a (usually fictional) button that a military or government leader could press to launch nuclear weapons.\\n\\nAkin to fire alarm switches, some big red buttons, when deployed with suitable visual and audible warnings such as flashing lights and sirens for extreme exigent emergencies, are known as \\\"scram switches\\\" (from the slang term scram, \\\"get out of here\\\"). Generally, such buttons are connected to large scale functions, beyond a regular fire alarm, such as automated shutdown procedures, complete facility power cut, fire suppression like halogen release, etc.\\n\\nA variant of this is the scramble switch which triggers an alarm to activate emergent personnel to proactively attend to and go to such disasters. An air raid siren at an air base initiates such action, where the fighter pilots are alerted and \\\"scrambled\\\" to their planes to defend the base.\\n\\n\",\n          \"WriteOnline\\n\\nWriteOnline is an online word processor from Crick Software that incorporates writing support tools and is designed for schools and colleges.\\n\\nWriteOnline is a WYSIWYG, page-view word processor which includes software speech, word prediction, Wordbars and a graphic organiser.\\n\\nWriteOnline includes features to make it accessible for users with visual impairments, and also includes a switch accessible onscreen keyboard for users unable to use a standard keyboard.\\n\\nWriteOnline is a Java application.

The originality of this aircraft was the shape of the fuselage, designed for minimum drag and acting as a tube fan, similar to the way the modern vertical take off aircraft and helicopters are designed. This shape reduced drag and increased the efficiency of the propeller. Helped by the Minister of Education, Spiru Haret, who also helped Aurel Vlaicu, in 1909 he went to France to acquire an engine for his aircraft. In Paris he sent a survey \\\"Laws of air dynamics\\\" to the French Academy, study that was published in \\\"La France automobile et a\\u00c3\\u00a9rienne\\\" magazine, on 15 May 1909. Goliescu patented his invention in France (patent no. 402329). In the same year he learned to fly and he built an updated version of his aircraft, this time in full size. The aircraft had a half cylinder fuselage, but still the air from the propeller flowed through as in the first model. He flies with his aircraft for the first time, in November 1909, on Juvisy airfield, near Paris, and he reaches an altitude of about 50 m. It was for the first time to fly an aircraft with a tubed propeller.\\n\\nAfter his flights, only in 1932, the Italian engineer Luigi Stipa will build an aircraft with a \\\"barrel fuselage\\\" under the name of Stipa-Caproni but the concept will reach its dedication after the Second World War, being successfully implemented in helicopters like SA-365 Dauphin, RAH-66 Comanche or the new X-35 fighter.\\n\\nBetween 1932 and 1936, he flight tested his \\\"Aviocoleopter\\\", the first vertical take-off and landing aircraft.\\n\\n\",\n          \"Push-button\\n\\nA push-button (also spelled pushbutton) or simply button is a simple switch mechanism for controlling some aspect of a machine or a process. Buttons are typically made out of hard material, usually plastic or metal. The surface is usually flat or shaped to accommodate the human finger or hand, so as to be easily depressed or pushed. Buttons are most often biased switches, although many un-biased buttons (due to their physical nature) still require a spring to return to their un-pushed state.\\nTerms for the \\\"pushing\\\" of a button include pressing, depressing, mashing, slapping, hitting, and punching.\\n\\nThe \\\"push-button\\\" has been utilized in calculators, push-button telephones, kitchen appliances, and various other mechanical and electronic devices, home and commercial.\\n\\nIn industrial and commercial applications, push buttons can be connected together by a mechanical linkage so that the act of pushing one button causes the other button to be released. In this way, a stop button can \\\"force\\\" a start button to be released. This method of linkage is used in simple manual operations in which the machine or process has no electrical circuits for control.\\n\\nRed pushbuttons can also have large heads (called mushroom heads) for easy operation and to facilitate the stopping of a machine. These pushbuttons are called emergency stop buttons and for increased safety are mandated by the electrical code in many jurisdictions. This large mushroom shape can also be found in buttons for use with operators who need to wear gloves for their work and could not actuate a regular flush-mounted push button.\\n\\nAs an aid for operators and users in industrial or commercial applications, a pilot light is commonly added to draw the attention of the user and to provide feedback if the button is pushed. Typically this light is included into the center of the pushbutton and a lens replaces the pushbutton hard center disk. The source of the energy to illuminate the light is not directly tied to the contacts on the back of the pushbutton but to the action the pushbutton controls. In this way a start button when pushed will cause the process or machine operation to be started and a secondary contact designed into the operation or process will close to turn on the pilot light and signify the action of pushing the button caused the resultant process or action to start.\\n\\nTo avoid an operator from pushing the wrong button in error, pushbuttons are often color-coded to associate them with their function. Commonly used colors are red for stopping the machine or process and green for starting the machine or process.\\n\\nIn popular culture, the phrase \\\"the button\\\" (sometimes capitalized) refers to a (usually fictional) button that a military or government leader could press to launch nuclear weapons.\\n\\nAkin to fire alarm switches, some big red buttons, when deployed with suitable visual and audible warnings such as flashing lights and sirens for extreme exigent emergencies, are known as \\\"scram switches\\\" (from the slang term scram, \\\"get out of here\\\").
