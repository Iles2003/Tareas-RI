Replication forks stall at CGG repeats in a length-dependent manner in primate cells and in yeast. Saccharomyces cerevisiae proteins Tof1 and Mrc1 facilitate replication fork progression through CGG repeats. Remarkably, the fork-stabilizing role of Mrc1 does not involve its checkpoint function. Thus, chromosomal fragility might occur when forks stalled at expanded CGG repeats escape the S-phase checkpoint.\",\n          \"The mechanisms by which melanoma and other cancer cells evade anti-tumor immunity remain incompletely understood. Here, we show that the growth of tumors formed by mutant Braf(V600E) mouse melanoma cells in an immunocompetent host requires their production of prostaglandin E2, which suppresses immunity and fuels tumor-promoting inflammation. Genetic ablation of cyclooxygenases (COX) or prostaglandin E synthases in Braf(V600E) mouse melanoma cells, as well as in Nras(G12D) melanoma or in breast or colorectal cancer cells, renders them susceptible to immune control and provokes a shift in the tumor inflammatory profile toward classic anti-cancer immune pathways. This mouse COX-dependent inflammatory signature is remarkably conserved in human cutaneous melanoma biopsies, arguing for COX activity as a driver of immune suppression across species. Pre-clinical data demonstrate that inhibition of COX synergizes with anti-PD-1 blockade in inducing eradication of tumors, implying that COX inhibitors could be useful adjuvants for immune-based therapies in cancer patients.\",\n          \"\\u03b2-Lactamase evolution presents to the infectious disease community a major challenge in the treatment of infections caused by multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria. Because over 1,000 of these naturally occurring \\u03b2-lactamases exist, attempts to correlate structure and function have become daunting. Although new enzymes in the extended-spectrum \\u03b2-lactamase (ESBL) families are frequently identified, the older CTX-M-14 and CTX-M-15 enzymes have become the most prevalent ESBLs in global surveillance. Carbapenemases with either serine-based or zinc-facilitated hydrolysis mechanisms are posing some of the most critical problems. Most geographical regions now report KPC serine carbapenemases and the metallo-\\u03b2-lactamases VIM, IMP, and NDM-1, even though NDM-1 was only recently identified. The rapid emergence of these newer enzymes, with multiple \\u03b2-lactamases appearing in a single organism, makes the design of new \\u03b2-lactamase inactivators or \\u03b2-lactamase-stable \\u03b2-lactams all the more difficult. Combination therapy will likely be required to counteract the continuing evolution of these insidious enzymes in multidrug-resistant pathogens.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"title\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5181,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Direct reprogramming of fibroblasts into neural stem cells by defined factors.\",\n          \"Passive Surveillance for I. scapularis Ticks: Enhanced Analysis for Early Detection of Emerging Lyme Disease Risk\",\n          \"Epidemiological expansion, structural studies, and clinical challenges of new \\u03b2-lactamases from gram-negative bacteria.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",
